It deals with the idea of being in a relationship where there’s some element of desperation and pain in it, where you’re yearning for something that you don’t quite have yet, it’s just right there, and you just, like, can’t reach it. So, this has some of my favorite lyrics on it.\" I wouldn't necessarily call this a positive sentiment. I would say it is more neutral to negative.\n",
